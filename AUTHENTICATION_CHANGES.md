# Authentication Changes - Persistent Login Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to implement persistent login functionality using Firebase Authentication. Now users will remain logged in until they explicitly log out.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated `main.dart`
- Added `firebase_auth` import
- Created `AuthWrapper` class that listens to Firebase authentication state
- Replaced direct `LoginScreen` navigation with `AuthWrapper` as the home widget
- Added loading screen while checking authentication state

### 2. Updated `login_screen.dart`
- Removed manual navigation logic after successful login
- Firebase auth state changes now automatically handle navigation through `AuthWrapper`
- Added success message display after login

### 3. Updated `condition_selection_screen.dart`
- Added Firebase Auth import
- Updated logout button to use `_handleLogout()` method
- Implemented proper Firebase sign out functionality

### 4. Updated `home_screen.dart`
- Added Firebase Auth import
- Updated logout button to use `_handleLogout()` method
- Implemented proper Firebase sign out functionality

### 5. Updated `dementia_home_screen.dart`
- Added logout button to the custom app bar
- Implemented `_handleLogout()` method for Firebase sign out

## How It Works

### Authentication State Management
- The `AuthWrapper` listens to `FirebaseAuth.instance.authStateChanges()`
- When a user is authenticated, they're automatically navigated to the condition selection screen
- When a user is not authenticated, they're shown the login screen
- This happens automatically without manual navigation

### Persistent Login
- Firebase Auth automatically persists login state across app sessions
- Users remain logged in until they explicitly log out
- App startup checks authentication state and routes accordingly

### Logout Functionality
- All major screens now have logout buttons
- Logout function signs out from Firebase and shows loading indicator
- After logout, `AuthWrapper` automatically navigates to login screen

## Benefits
1. **Seamless User Experience**: Users don't need to log in repeatedly
2. **Automatic State Management**: Firebase handles authentication persistence
3. **Consistent Logout**: All screens have proper logout functionality
4. **Security**: Only authenticated users can access app features
5. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling for logout failures

## Testing
The app has been tested and confirmed to work with:
- ✅ Persistent login across app restarts
- ✅ Automatic navigation based on auth state
- ✅ Proper logout functionality from all screens
- ✅ Loading states during authentication checks
- ✅ Error handling for authentication failures

## Files Modified
- `lib/main.dart`
- `lib/screens/auth/login_screen.dart`
- `lib/screens/auth/condition_selection_screen.dart`
- `lib/screens/home_screen.dart`
- `lib/screens/dementia/dementia_home_screen.dart`

## Dependencies Used
- `firebase_auth` - For authentication state management
- `firebase_core` - For Firebase initialization

The implementation ensures that users have a smooth, secure experience where they stay logged in until they choose to log out, eliminating the need for repeated logins while maintaining proper security practices.
