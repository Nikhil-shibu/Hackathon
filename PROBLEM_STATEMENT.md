# PROBLEM STATEMENT 1

## Software Solutions for the Specially-Abled Community

Many specially-abled individuals and their caregivers lack tailored software to support independence, accessibility, and inclusion in daily life, education, or social settings.

## Challenge

- Limited tools for independent task management (physical, cognitive, sensory challenges).
- Insufficient digital resources for caregivers to manage routines or track progress.
- Inadequate accessible platforms for education, social, or professional inclusion.

## Question

How can software solutions enhance the quality of life for specially-abled individuals and caregivers, promoting independence and accessibility?

## Objectives

1. **Empower Independence**: Build software (apps, tools) for tasks like communication or scheduling.
2. **Support Caregivers**: Develop tools for routine management, progress tracking, or timely support.
3. **Enhance Accessibility**: Create inclusive platforms for education, social, or professional settings.
4. **Leverage Assistive Tech**: Integrate features like screen readers or voice commands.
5. **Incorporate Feedback**: Include user feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement.

## Suggested Directions

- Apps for communication, learning, or therapy tracking.
- Assistive tools (e.g., screen readers, gesture-based interfaces).

- Caregiver tools for health/routine management.
- Sensory-friendly social platforms.

## Target Users
